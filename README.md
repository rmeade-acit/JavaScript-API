# JavaScript-API

In this project, you'll delve into the exciting world of web development and learn how to use third-party APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to create interactive and dynamic web applications. You'll explore a variety of free APIs, each offering different types of data and functionalities, and put your JavaScript skills to the test. This project will not only improve your understanding of JavaScript but will also introduce you to how the vast majority of modern websites operate.


## Project Goals
* Gain practical experience using JavaScript to fetch and process data from external APIs.- Learn how to work with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data.
* Improve your understanding of asynchronous programming (AJAX).
* Develop your skills in DOM manipulation and user interface design.
* Create a small portfolio of three projects each showcasing a different skill level and type of API interaction.


## Project RequirementsAPI Selection:

You must select one API from each of the following categories:
* Beginner: APIs with simple data structures and straightforward requests.
* Intermediate: APIs with more complex data, some query parameters, and requiring more logic.
* Advanced: APIs with complex data, more interactions, or sophisticated UI.

## API Categories and Choices:
### Beginner APIs (Choose One):
 * Advice Slip API (https://api.adviceslip.com/): Returns random pieces of advice.
 * The Nationalize.io API (https://nationalize.io/): Predicts the nationality of a given name.
### Intermediate APIs (Choose One):
 * Open Trivia Database (https://opentdb.com/api_config.php): Offers trivia questions. Please note that you need to filter by category and only use "General Knowledge".
 * The Dog API (https://thedogapi.com/): Provides information and pictures of dog breeds.

### Advanced APIs (Choose One):
 * The MealDB API (https://www.themealdb.com/api.php): Provides a large database of recipes, including ingredients, instructions, and images.
 * REST Countries (https://restcountries.com/): Provides detailed information about countries.

## Project Implementation:
For each chosen API, you will create a simple web application that demonstrates how to:
 * Fetch data from the API using JavaScript (fetch() or XMLHttpRequest).
 * Parse the JSON data you receive.
 * Display the relevant data on your webpage.
 * Allow the user to interact with the data if applicable.
Your projects should be well-organized, with clean and commented code.
Each API should be in it's own folder
Implement proper error handling.

## Planning:
Before you start coding, sketch out a plan for each of your three projects. This should include:
 * The intended functionality and user interface.
 * How you will fetch, process, and display the data.
 * Any necessary user interactions.
 * How you will use the information from the API that you receive.
Documentation:
 * Document your code thoroughly using comments.
 * Provide a brief explanation of the purpose of each project and the API it uses, as well as why you choose that specific one.

## Presentation:
 * Be prepared to demonstrate your project to your teacher and explain how it uses the APIs you selected.
* Discuss any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.
